	<h1>CS Graduate Student Machine Learning Reading Group</h1>
	<p>In this reading group we present talks on topics related to  Machine Learning, Computer Vision, topics beyond standard classroom setting or original research. It is meant to be a friendly, slightly informal environment where questions are encouraged at all points throught the talk. If you are interested in leading a discussion on a topic or giving a talk please email at cjtonde [at] cs [dot] rutgers [dot] edu.</p>
