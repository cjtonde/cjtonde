<ul><li> [6/28/2012] Solutions to problems in the homework will be posted soon (by tommorow). Homework 2 is posted. </li></ul>
<ul><li> [6/29/2012] Since coming Tuesday the TA won't be able to conduct the recitation after the class I would be takin<ul><li> [6/29/2012] It turns out the solution to the even numbered problems in the book cannot be posted online or any public forum. Hence, I will also be posting odd numbered 
questios alongwith even numbered ones. The solutions for odd numbered problems can be found out at the back of the book or in the Students Solution Manual for the book and the TA 
will discuss the solutions for the even numbered problems in the recitation. A copy of Students solution is available on reserve at SERC library.</li></ul>
<ul><li> [6/29/2012] Found a nice guide about how to use the solutions manual. See <a href = "http://academic.cuesta.edu/mturner/study/solution.pdf"> link</a>. Also, it a good 
idea to form study group(s) so that you can share the Student Manual solve problems together and this can be done at SERC (possibly over
weekends).</li> </ul>
