<h1>Homeworks and Quizzes</h1>
<a href= "./index.html"> <== Home.</a>
<p>
Note: <b> The homeworks questions that are for practice need not be submitted. Only submit problems which have
been asked for grading by the specified due date.</b> Solutions to homework problems from homework will be posted after the due date.
The even numbered problems will be soved in recitations by the TA.  Solve ungraded problems of each type for practice until you think you
understood the concept involved and only submit the graded questions.

<br>
<br>
Homework guidelines:
<ul><li>Please write concisely and clearly and donot try to talk problems to death..</li></ul>
<ul><li>Add a cover page with your first name and lastname (middle initial too if you think its neccessary) at the top. Add a table with three
columns, first for the problem number, second for the page number and third should be empty for the the scores. If you haven't done a specific
question please write "Not done" in place of the page number.</li></ul> 
<ul> <li> Write the correct page number and your name at the top of each page and staple all the pages together.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It is recommended that you type in the solutions but this is not neccessary, it may be made mandatory if the TA has trouble with your
handwriting.</li></ul>
<ul><li> No late homeworks please.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On collaboration: It is in your best interest if you solve the problems yourself. Discussing problems (with other students or with me or
the
TA) can also be helpful in case you're stuck, but before seeking outside help it's almost always beneficial to spend enough time with a
problem so as to know what the difficulty is. Donot exchange any written work related to an assignment with others and do your writeups
independently.</li></ul>
